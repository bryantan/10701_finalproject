Science is a systematic attempt to understand natural phenomena in as much detail and depth as possible, and use the knowledge so gained to predict, modify and control phenomena.
We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena.
This approach is called <b>reductionism</b> and is at the heart of physics.

The general law of conservation of energy is true for all forces and for any kind of transformation between different forms of energy.
According to Einstein’s theory, mass m is equivalent to energy E given by the relation E= mc 2 , where c is speed of light in vacuum.
The total linear momentum and the total angular momentum (both vectors) of an isolated system are also conserved quantities.
The physical quantities that remain unchanged in a process are called conserved quantities.
<b>CHAPTER</b> <b><b></b> <b>TWO</b> <b>U</b> <b>NITS</b>   <b>AND</b>  <b>MEASUREMENT</b> <b>2.1</b>  <b>INTRODUCTION</b> Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally accepted reference standard called <b>unit</b>.
The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called <b>fundamental</b> or <b>base</b> <b>units</b>.
Such units obtained for the derived quantities are called <b>derived</b> <b>units</b>.
A complete set of these units, both the base units and derived units, is known as the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b><i>.</i>

(1983) Mass kilogram kg The kilogram is equal to the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram (a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder) kept at international Bureau of Weights and Measures, at Sevres, near Paris, France.
(1889) Time second s The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom.
(1967) Electric ampere A The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in current two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 210 –7 newton per metre of length.
(1948) Thermo kelvin K The kelvin, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic dynamic temperature of the triple point of water.
(1967) Temperature Amount of mole mol The mole is the amount of substance of a system, which contains substance as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon - 12.
(1971) Luminous candela cd The candela is the luminous intensity, in a given intensity direction, of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 54010 12 hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683 watt per steradian.
This is called <b>parallax</b>.
The distance between the two points of observation is called the <b>basis</b>.
The ∠ASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by symbol θ is called the <b>parallax</b> <b>angle</b><i> </i>or <b>parallactic</b> <b>angle</b><i>.</i>
These are 1 fermi = 1 f = 10 –15 m 1 angstrom = 1 Å = 10 –10 m 1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance of the Sun from the Earth) = 1.496 × 10 11 m 1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 × 10 15 m (distance that light travels with velocity of 3 × 10 8 m s –1 in 1 year) 1 parsec = 3.08 × 10 16 m (Parsec is the distance at which average radius of earth’s orbit subtends an angle of 1 arc second) <b>2.4</b>  <b>MEASUREMENT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>MASS</b> Mass is a basic property of matter.
In this case, there is an important standard unit of mass, called the <b>unified</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> <b>unit</b> <b></b>(u), which has been established for expressing the mass of atoms as 1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u = (1/12) of the mass of an atom of carbon-12 isotope ( ) 6 12 C including the mass of electrons = 1.66 10 –27 kg Mass of commonly available objects can be determined by a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop.
This uncertainty is called <b>error</b>.
The accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how close the measured value is to the true value of the quantity.
Precision tells us to what resolution or limit the quantity is measured.
<i><b>Systematic</b> <b>errors</b></i> The<b></b> <b>systematic</b> <b>errors</b> <b></b>are those errors that tend to be in one direction, either positive or negative.
<i><b>Random</b> <b>errors</b></i> The <b>random</b> <b>errors<i></b> <b></i></b>are those errors, which occur irregularly and hence are random with respect <b>Table</b> <b>2.5</b>   <b>Range</b> <b>and</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> © NCERT not to be republished PHYSICS 24 to sign and size.
The <b>least</b> <b>count</b> <b>error<i></b> <b></i></b>is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument.

(b) The arithmetic mean of all the <i>absolute errors</i> is taken as the <i>final </i>or<i> mean absolute error</i> of the value of the physical quantity <i>a</i>.

Relative error = Δ <i>a</i> <i>mean</i> / <i>a</i> <i>mean</i> (2.9) When the relative error is expressed in per cent, it is called the <b>percentage</b> <b>error</b> <b></b>( δ <i>a</i> ).

Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.
The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called fundamental or base units.
Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units.
A complete set of units, both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.
The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.
Motion is change in position of an object with time.
We shall confine ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight line, also known as <b>rectilinear</b> <b>motion</b>.
<b>3.2</b>   <b>POSITION,</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>LENGTH</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DISPLACEMENT</b> Earlier you learnt that motion is change in position of an object with time.
<b>This</b> <b>distance</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> <b></b>traversed by the car<b>.</b>
Then its displacement, denoted by Δ<i>x</i>, in time Δ<i>t</i> = (<i>t</i> 2 -<i> t</i> 1 ), is given by the difference between the final and initial positions : Δ<i>x</i> = <i>x</i> 2 – <i>x</i> 1 (We use the Greek letter delta ( Δ) to denote a change in a quantity.) If <i>x</i> 2 &gt; <i>x</i> 1 , Δ<i>x </i>is positive; and if <i>x</i> 2 &lt; <i>x</i> 1 , Δ<i>x </i>is negative.
The point of intersection of these three axes is called origin (O) and serves as the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b>.
This coordinate system along with a clock constitutes a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference</b>.
<b>The</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> <b>traversed</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>object.</b><i> </i>For example, for motion of the car from O to P, the path length is +360 m and the displacement is +360 m.
If an object moving along the straight line covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in <b>uniform</b> <b>motion</b> along a straight line.
Average velocity is defined as the change in position or displacement ( Δ<i>x</i>) divided by the time intervals ( Δ<i>t </i>), in which the displacement occurs : <i>v</i> <i>x</i> <i>x</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> <i>x</i> <i>t</i> <i>2</i> <i>1</i> <i>2</i> <i>1</i> = − − = Δ Δ (3.1) where <i>x</i> 2 <i> </i> and <i>x</i> 1 are the positions of the object at time <i>t</i> 2 and <i>t</i> 1 , respectively.
Like displacement, average velocity is also a vector quantity.
<b>Average</b> <b>speed<i></b> <b></i></b>is defined as the total path length travelled divided by the total time interval during which the motion has taken place : <i>Averag e speed</i> <i>Total path lengt h</i> <i>Total time interval </i> = (3.2) Average speed has obviously the same unit (m s –1 ) as that of velocity.
If the motion of an object is along a straight line and in the<i> </i><b>same</b> <b>direction</b>, the magnitude of displacement is equal to the total path length.
The velocity at an instant is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval Δ<i>t</i> becomes infinitesimally small.
<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>uniform</b> <b>motion,</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>instants</b>.
<b>Instantaneous</b> <b>speed</b> or simply speed<b></b> <b></b>is the magnitude of velocity.
The average acceleration <i>a</i> over a time interval is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time interval : 2 1 2 1 – – <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>a</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> (3.4) where <i>v</i> 2 and <i>v</i> 1 <i> </i>are the instantaneous velocities or simply velocities at time <i>t</i> 2 and <i>t</i> 1 .
An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph for any moving object is that<i> </i><b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>time</b> <b>interval</b>.<i> </i>A general proof of this <i><b>Fig.</b>
An object is said to be in <i>motion</i> if its position changes with time.
<i>Path length</i> is defined as the total length of the path traversed by an object.
<i>Displacement</i> is the change in position :<b></b>  Δ<i>x </i> = <i>x</i> 2 – <i>x</i> 1 .
An object is said to be in <i>uniform motion</i> in a straight line if its displacement is equal in equal intervals of time.
<i>Average velocity</i> is the displacement divided by the time interval in which the displacement occurs : <i>v</i> <i>x</i> <i>t</i> = Δ Δ On an <i>x-t</i> graph, the average velocity over a time interval is the slope of the line connecting the initial and final positions corresponding to that interval.
<i>Average Speed</i> is the ratio of total path length traversed and the corresponding time interval.
The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval.
<i>Instantaneous velocity</i><b></b> <b></b>or simply velocity is defined as the limit of the average velocity as the time interval Δ<i>t</i> becomes infinitesimally small : d d <i>t</i> <i>0</i> <i>t</i> <i>0</i> <i>x</i> <i>x</i> <i>v</i> <i>lim v</i> <i>lim</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> The velocity at a particular instant is equal to the slope of the tangent drawn on position-time graph at that instant.
<i>Average acceleration</i><b></b> <b></b>is the change in velocity divided by the time interval during which the change occurs : <i>v</i> <i>a</i> <i>t</i> 9.
<i>Instantaneous acceleration</i><b></b> <b></b>is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval Δ<i>t</i> goes to zero : d d <i>t</i> <i>0</i> <i>t</i> <i>0</i> <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>a</i> <i>lim a</i> <i>lim</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that instant of time.
The area under the velocity-time curve between times <i>t</i> 1 and <i>t</i> 2 is equal to the displacement of the object during that interval of time.
For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement <i>x</i>, time taken <i>t</i>, initial velocity <i>v</i> 0 , final velocity <i>v</i> and acceleration <i>a </i>are related by a set of simple equations called <i>kinematic equations of motion :</i> <i> v = v</i> <i>0</i> <i> + at</i> <i> </i> <i>x</i> <i>v t</i> <i>1</i> <i>2</i> <i>at</i> <i>0</i> <i>2</i> = + <i> </i> <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>2ax</i> <i>2</i> <i>0</i> <i>2</i> = + if the position of the object at time <i>t</i> = 0 is 0.
Basically, the difference is that a <b>direction</b> <b></b>is associated with a vector but not with a scalar.
A scalar quantity is a quantity with magnitude only.
Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided <b>4.1</b> Introduction <b>4.2</b> Scalars and vectors <b>4.3</b> Multiplication of vectors by real numbers <b>4.4</b> Addition and subtraction of vectors — graphical method <b>4.5</b> Resolution of vectors <b>4.6</b> Vector addition — analytical method <b>4.7</b> Motion in a plane <b>4.8</b> Motion in a plane with constant acceleration <b>4.9</b> Relative velocity in two dimensions <b>4.10</b> Projectile motion <b>4.11</b> Uniform circular motion Summary Points to ponder Exercises Additional exercises © NCERT not to be republished PHYSICS 66 just as the ordinary numbers <b>*</b> .
A <b>vector</b> quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and obeys the <b>triangle</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b><i> </i>or equivalently the <b>parallelogram</b> <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>addition</b>.
So, a vector is specified by giving its magnitude by a number and its direction.
If the object moves from P to P ′, the vector <b>PP</b> ′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called the <b>displacement</b> <b>vector</b> <b></b>corresponding to motion from point P (at time <i>t</i>) to point P ′ (at time <i>t</i>′).
It is important to note that displacement vector is the straight line joining the initial and final positions and does not depend on the actual path undertaken by the object between the two positions.
Therefore, the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> <b>is</b> <b>either</b> <b>less</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>between</b> <b>two</b> <b>points</b><i>.</i>
<b>4.2.2</b>  <b>Equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Vectors</b> Two vectors <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are said to be equal if, and only if, they have the same magnitude and the same direction.
<b>4.3</b> <b>MULTIPLICATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>VECTORS</b> <b>BY</b> <b>REAL</b> <b>NUMBERS</b> Multiplying a vector <b>A</b> with a positive number λ gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by the factor λ but the direction is the same as that of <b>A</b> <b></b>: ⏐ λ <b>A</b> ⏐ = λ ⏐ <b>A</b> ⏐ if λ &gt; 0.
© NCERT not to be republished PHYSICS 68 arranged head to tail, this graphical method is called the <b>head-to-tail</b> <b>method</b>.
The two vectors and their resultant form three sides of a triangle, so this method is also known as <b>triangle</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>vector</b> <b>addition</b>.
Thus, vector addition is <b>commutative</b>: <b>A</b> <b></b>+ <b>B</b> <b></b>= <b>B</b> <b></b>+ <b>A</b> (4.1) The addition of vectors also obeys the associative law as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d).
Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the same, but the directions are opposite, the resultant vector has zero magnitude and is represented by <b>0</b> <b></b>called a <b>null</b> <b>vector</b><i> </i>or a <b>zero</b> <b>vector</b><i> </i>: <b>A</b> <b></b>– <b>A</b> <b></b>= <b>0</b> <b></b>|<b>0</b>|= 0 (4.3) Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its direction cannot be specified.
<b>Subtraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>vectors</b> <b></b>can be defined in terms of addition of vectors.
<i><b>Unit</b> <b>vectors</b></i>: A unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and points in a particular direction.

We can write Eq. (4.25) in a component form: Δ <b>r</b> ( ) ( ) = + − + <i>x'</i> <i>y'</i> <i>x</i> &#34; &#34; &#34; &#34; <b>i</b> <b>j</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> y = + &#34; &#34; <b>i</b> <b>j</b> Δ Δ <i>x</i> <i>y</i> where Δ <i>x</i> = <i>x</i> ′ – <i>x</i>, Δ <i>y</i> = <i>y</i> ′ – <i>y</i> (4.26) <b>Velocity</b> The average velocity ( ) <b>v</b> of an object is the ratio of the displacement and the corresponding time interval : <b>v</b> <b>r</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> = = + = + Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ <i>t</i> <i>x y</i> <i>t</i> <i>x</i> <i>t</i> <i>y</i> <i>t</i> &#34; &#34; &#34; &#34; (4.27) Or, $ ˆ <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <b>v</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> Since <b>v</b> <b>r</b> = Δ Δ<i>t</i> , the direction of the average velocity is the same as that of Δ <b>r</b> (Fig. 4.12).
The <b>velocity</b> (instantaneous velocity) is given by the limiting value of the average velocity as the time interval approaches zero : <b>v</b> <b>r</b> <b>r</b> = = → <i>lim</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> Δ Δ Δ 0 d d (4.28) The meaning of the limiting process can be easily understood with the help of Fig 4.13(a) to (d).
<b>The</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>velocity</b> <b><b>v</b> is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for three decreasing values of Δ <i>t</i>, i.e. Δ <i>t</i> 1 , Δ <i>t</i> 2 , and Δ <i>t</i> 3 , ( Δ <i>t</i> 1 &gt; Δ <i>t</i> 2 &gt; Δ <i>t</i> 3 ).
<b>Acceleration</b> The <b>average</b> <b>acceleration</b><i> </i><b>a</b> of an object for a time interval Δ<i>t</i> moving in <i>x-y</i> plane is the change in velocity divided by the time interval : ( ) <b>a</b> <b>v</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> = = + = + Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ t <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>t</i> <i>v</i> <i>t</i> <i>v</i> <i>t</i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> &#34; &#34; &#34; &#34; (4.31a) Or, <b>a</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> = + <i>a</i> <i>a</i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> &#34; &#34; .
<b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>dimension,</b> <b>the</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>straight</b> <b>line</b> <b>(either</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>di-</b> <b>rection</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction).</b>
<b>However,</b> <b>for</b> <b>motion</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>dimensions,</b> <b>veloc-</b> <b>ity</b> <b>and</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>vectors</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>angle</b> <b>between</b> <b>0°</b> <b>and</b> <b>180°</b>    <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>
An object that is in flight after being thrown or projected is called a <b>projectile</b>.
<i><b>Maximum</b> <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>projectile</b></i> The maximum height <i>h</i> <i>m</i> reached by the projectile can be calculated by substituting <i>t = t</i> <i>m</i> in Eq. (4.38) : ( ) <i>y</i> <i>h</i> <i>v</i> <i>v</i> <i>g</i> <i>g v</i> <i>g</i> <i>m</i> <i>0</i> <i>0</i> <i>0</i> = = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟⎟− ⎛ ⎝ ⎜⎜ ⎞ ⎠ ⎟⎟ sin sin 2 sin 0 0 0 2 θ θ θ Or, ( ) <i>h</i> <i>v</i> <i>m</i> <i>0</i> = sin 0 θ 2 2<i>g</i> (4.42) <i><b>Horizontal</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>projectile</b></i> The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile from its initial position (<i>x = y = </i>0<i>)</i> to the position where it passes <i>y </i>= 0 during its fall is called the <b>horizontal</b> <b>range</b>, <i>R</i>.
<b>4.11</b>  <b>UNIFORM</b> <b>CIRCULAR</b> <b>MOTION</b> When an object follows a circular path at a constant speed, the motion of the object is called <b>uniform</b> <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b>.
<i>a</i> c = <i>v</i> <i>R</i> ⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝ ⎠ <i>v</i> = <i>v</i> <i>2</i> <i>/R</i> (4.44) Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with speed <i>v</i> in a circle of radius <i>R</i> has a magnitude <i>v</i> <i>2</i> <i>/R</i> and is always <b>directed</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> <b>centre</b>.
This is why this acceleration is called <b>centripetal</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b></b>(a term proposed by Newton).
<i>Scalar quantities </i>are quantities with magnitudes only.
<i>Vector quantities </i>are quantities with magnitude and direction both.
A vector <b>A</b> <b></b>multiplied by a real number λ is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times the magnitude of the vector <b>A</b> <b></b>and whose direction is the same or opposite depending upon whether λ is positive or negative.
Vector addition is <i>commutative </i>: <b>A</b> <b></b>+ <b>B</b> <b></b>= <b>B</b> <b></b>+ <b>A</b> It also obeys the <i>associative law </i>: (<b>A</b> + <b>B</b>) + <b>C</b> <b></b>= <b>A</b> <b></b>+ (<b>B</b> <b></b>+ <b>C</b>) 6.
A <i>null </i>or <i>zero vector </i>is a vector with zero magnitude.
The <i>subtraction </i>of vector <b>B</b> <b></b>from <b>A</b> <b></b>is defined as the sum of <b>A</b> <b></b>and – <b>B</b> <b></b>: <b>A</b> <b>–</b> <b><b>B</b> <b></b>= <b>A</b>+ ( – <b>B</b>) 8.
A <i>unit vector </i>associated with a vector <b>A</b> has magnitude one and is along the vector <b>A</b>: ˆ <b>n</b> <b>A</b> <b>A</b> = The unit vectors &#34; &#34; &#34; <b>i,</b> <b>j,</b> <b>k</b> are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of the <i>x-, y</i>-, and <i>z-</i>axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.
A vector <b>A</b> <b></b>can be expressed as <b>A</b> <b>i</b> <b>+</b> <b>j</b> = <i>A</i> <i>A</i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> &#34; &#34; where <i>A</i> <i>x</i> , <i>A</i> <i>y</i> are its components along <i>x-</i>, and <i>y -</i>axes.
The <i>position vector </i>of an object in <i>x-y</i> plane is given by <b>r</b> <b>=</b> <b>i</b> <b>j</b> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> &#34; &#34; + and the <i>displacement </i>from position <b>r</b> to position <b>r’</b> <b></b>is given by Δ<b>r</b> <b></b>= <b>r</b> ′ − <b>r</b> = ′ − + ′ − ( ) ( ) <i>x</i> <i>x</i> <i>y</i> <i>y</i> &#34; &#34; <b>i</b> <b>j</b> = Δ + Δ <i>x y</i> &#34; &#34; <b>i</b> <b>j</b> 13.
If an object undergoes a displacement Δ<b>r</b> in time Δ<i>t</i>, its <i>average velocity</i> is given by <b>v</b> <b></b>= Δ Δ <b>r</b> <i>t</i> .

An object that is in flight after being projected is called a <i>projectile</i>.
When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is called <i>uniform circular motion</i>.
The angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance.
Inertia means <b>‘resistance to change’</b>.
Galileo’s law of inertia was his starting point which he formulated as the <b>first law of motion</b><i>:</i> <b>Every body continues to be in its state</b> <b>of rest or of uniform motion ina straight</b> <b>line unless compelled by some external</b> <b>force to act otherwise.</b> The state of rest or uniform linear motion both imply zero acceleration.
The first law of motion can, therefore, be simply expressed as: <b>If the net external force on a body is zero, its</b> <b>acceleration is zero.
Acceleration can be non</b><b>zero only if there is a net external force on</b> <b>the body.</b> Two kinds of situations are encountered in the application of this law in practice.
<i><b>Momentum</b></i> Momentum of a body is defined to bethe product of its mass <i>m</i> and velocity <b>v</b>, and is denoted by <b>p</b>: <b>p </b><i>= m </i><b>v</b><b> </b>(5.1) Momentum is clearly a vector quantity.
We can feel this while rotating a</i> <i>stone ina horizontal circle with uniform speed</i> <i>by means of a string.</i> These qualitative observations lead to the <b>second law of motion</b> expressed by Newton as follows : <b>The rate of change of momentum of a body is</b> <b>directly proportional to the applied force and</b> <b>takes place in the direction in which the force</b> <b>acts</b>.
This unit is known as <b>newton</b><i> </i>: 1<i> </i>N = 1 kg ms -2 .
This idea was expressed by Newton in the form of the <b>third law of motion</b>.
A simple and clear way of stating the third law is as follows : <b>Forces always occur in pairs.
Force on a</b> <b>body A by B is equal and opposite to the</b> <b>force on the body B by A.</b> 2.
This fact is known as the <b>law of conservation</b> <b>of momentum</b> : © NCERT not to be republished LAWS OF MOTION 9 9 ! <b>The total momentum of an isolated system</b> <b>of interacting particles is conserved.</b> An important example of the application of the law of conservation of momentum is the collision of two bodies.
<b>*</b> As the name suggests, a contact force on an object arises due to contact with some other object: solid or fluid.
Hence, it is called <b>static friction</b> .
Static friction opposes <b>impending motion</b> .
Note that it is not motion, but <b>relative motion </b>that the frictional force opposes.
Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased thus: <i>“Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion ina straight line,</i> <i>unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”</i>.
In simple terms, the First Law is <b>“If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”</b>.
Momentum (<b>p</b> ) of a body is the product of its mass <i>(m)</i> and velocity <i>(</i><b>v</b><i>)</i> : <b>p</b><i> = m </i><b>v</b> 4.
Newton’s second law of motion : <i>The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes</i> <i>place in the direction in which the force acts.
Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.
Newton’s third law of motion: <i>To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction</i> In simple terms, the law can be stated thus : <i>Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.
Force on a body A by body</i> <i>B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.</i> Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.
<i>Law of Conservation of Momentum</i> The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.
<b>Ideally a</b> <b>rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and</b> <b>unchanging shape.
<b>In pure translational motion at any</b> <b>instant of time all particles of the body have</b> <b>the same velocity.</b> Consider now the rolling motion of a solid metallic or wooden cylinder down the same inclined plane (Fig. 7.2).
The only possible motion of such a rigid body is <b>rotation</b>.
The line along which the body is fixed is termed as its <b>axis of rotation</b>.
You may notice that <b>in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed</b> <i><b>Fig 7.1</b></i> <i>Translational (sliding) motion of a block down</i> <i>an inclined plane.</i> <i>(Any point like P</i> <i>1</i> <i>or P</i> <i>2 </i><i>of the block moves</i> <i>with the same velocity at any instant of time.)</i> <i><b>Fig. 7.2</b></i> <i>Rolling motion of a cylinder It is not pure</i> <i>translational motion.
In fact, the velocity of</i> <i>the point of contact P</i> <i>3 </i><i>is zero at any instant,</i> <i>if the cylinder rolls without slipping.</i> 2015-16(20/01/2015) SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION 143 <b>axis, every particle of the body moves ina</b> <b>circle, which lies ina plane perpendicular to</b> <b>the axis and has its centre on the axis</b><i>.</i> Fig. 7.4 shows the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed axis (the <i>z</i>-axis of the frame of refer ence).
(You may try to reproduce the two types of motion shown using a rigid object like a heavy book.) We now recapitulate the most important observations of the present section: <b>The motion</b> <b>of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed</b> <b>in someway is either a pure translation ora</b> <b>combination of translation and rotation.
The</b> <b>motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or</b> <b>fixed in someway is rotation.</b> The rotation maybe about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or moving (e.g. an oscillating table fan).
The centre of mass of the system is that point C which is at a distance <i>X</i> from O, where <i>X</i> is given by 1 1 2 2 1 2 <i>m x</i> <i>m x</i> <i>X</i> <i>m</i> <i>m</i> + = + (7.1) In Eq. (7.1), <i>X</i> can be regarded as the mass- weighted mean of <i>x</i> 1 and <i>x</i> 2 .
If we have<i>n</i> particles of masses <i>m</i> 1 , <i>m</i> 2 , ...<i>m</i> <i>n</i> respectively, along a straight line taken as the <i>x</i>- axis, then by definition the position of the centre of the mass of the system of particles is given by 1 1 2 2 1 2 ....

Among these forces on each particle there will be <b>external</b> forces exerted by bodies outside the system and also <b>internal</b> forces exerted by the particles on one another.
Eq. (7.11) states that <b>the centre of mass</b> <b>of a system of particles moves as if all the</b> <b>mass of the</b><i> </i><b>system was concentrated at the</b> <b>centre of mass and all the external forces</b> <b>were applied at that point.</b> Notice, to determine the motion of the centre of mass no knowledge of internal forces of the system of particles is requir ed; for this purpose we need to know only the external forces.
